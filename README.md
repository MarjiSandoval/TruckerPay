Trucker Pay App

This app is designed with the truck driver in mind. It is intended for the driver to be able to enter his details into and get his gross load pay or weekly pay returned to him. 

Motivation:
I was a truck driver for a short time and I was always looking for ways to figure out my weekly pay as I went so there were no surprises on payday. I ended up having to do it all
on paper in the truck during my down time and that was tedious to say the least. After I stopped driving truck I was still interested in tracking pay as my husband still drives.
I designed a spreadsheet that I used to track his pay and it is great but wouldn't it be great if we could just pick up an app and plug in our information as we get it? So I 
decided to write this program.
